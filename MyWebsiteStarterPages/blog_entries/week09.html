<ul>
    <li>As per feedback of week 8 fixed issues related to it.Links were broken to source code because it was pointing to week7 folder.</li>
    <li>Starting work on project. After long search I have got an API to show case some project related work.</li>
    <li>Initially starting with some static data which is coming as response from API.Later on converting static data to AJAX calls</li>
    <li>The pages I am making for project work is added as week9. There is no source code,css or javascript links because later on they will be moved
    to project folder as complete website</li>
    <li>Data testing is performed in these pages</li>
    <li>Work on Home is still in progress. I have Taken help from bootstrap for home page development, youtube videos for google map.
    Most of the basic stuff I have used from my previous weeks experiments </li>
