    <li>Tried to keep all redundant code ins single files which are attached to index page.</li>
    <li>Horizondal nav bar constructed which act similar to angular routing.</li>
    <li>If time permits would like to add 2 more functionility rendering all IATA code from csv file to DOM and
     route details between different airport.</li>
    <li>My API call have limited hits, please let me know if no data is rendered. I'll replace old API key with knew one.</li>
    <li>Uploaded project and tested if all minimium functionalities are working on server. Will disable the project link
    as I am proceeding with project documentation.</li>
    <li>Initially I develope all the above mentioned features in angular js and bootstrap but after certain time
    I was facing issues with JSONP data handling. I tried several small experiments with jquery and ajax and tried to put together.
    Jquery gives you complete access to the type of rendering you need while Angular js don't provide such level of
    freedom I think.</li>
</ul>
