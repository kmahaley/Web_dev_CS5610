    <li>As Prof.Rasala said to continue working on project and keep adding functionalities and improve coding standard.
    I have worked on 4 points of this project which are mentioned below</li>
    <li>Fixed navigation bar-modified the index page to se background white, paddings were removed. aligned nav bar to the centered</li>
    <li>Googlemap issue- Due to fixed nav bar my google maps were overflowing over nav bar. That I fixed with modifying
    Z index</li>
    <li>Key press handler-I have added key  press handler along with search button</li>
    <li>Error function is AJAX- Sometime AJAX threw error with 404 so I have added code so that user can see error and
    modify its request.</li>
    <li>Testing on server fixing bugs found while checking links on home page.</li>
