                <p>
                    This project is part of my academic course CS5610 under Prof.Rasala. It aims to provide all sort of information
                    related to flights and airports. One can check flight performance and book ticket based on it. My site provides links
                    to sites which provides cheaper deals related to holidays, airline ticketing. You can also check the airport details
                    and its current weather condition. Googlemap API's are used to show live weather situation along with the geolocation.

                <p>To prepare a website which will have all what I have learnt in class and in doing experiments.
                I have taken this airline project beacause it is the most real time data and crucial mode of transport in today's life.</p>
